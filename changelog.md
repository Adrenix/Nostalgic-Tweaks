## Version 1.0.2 (1.18.1 & 1.18.2)
Small patch to help increase mod compatibility.
- Removed the mod's high global mixin priority.
- Added a small priority bump to some mixins that safely overrides some commonly used mods.
> It is possible that some conflicts might occur with other mods, but only if those other mods don't raise their priority above 1001.

## Version 1.0.1 (1.18.1 & 1.18.2)
Adds a few features to enhance the old fog tweak.
- Added new Key Bindings subcategory in the General settings menu.
- Added new Toggle Fog key binding (unbound by default).
> The toggle fog hotkey will change the render distance by switching between far (16 chunks), normal (8 chunks), short (4 chunks), and tiny (2 chunks).
- Removed "New" tags from currently released tweaks.

## Version 1.0.0 (1.18.2)
Initial release of Nostalgic Tweaks.
