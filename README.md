## Mod Description
Inspired by Exalm's **Old Days** mod, **Nostalgic Tweaks** brings back a plethora of **Minecraft Alpha, Beta, and Post Release** lost or changed gameplay elements. This mod is intended for nostalgic enthusiasts who want to relive the glory days of Minecraft Java edition by tweaking the mod to their nostalgic preference.

Some major nostalgic tweaks included in this mod are **old classic/alpha/beta light rendering**, **old classic/alpha/beta fog rendering**, **old classic/alpha/beta sky and void colors**, **2D floating items with disabled diffused lighting**, **old mob spawning**, **old combat mechanics & aesthetics** (_e.g., disabled particles, sounds, and mob animations_), and **so much more**! There are currently over **300+** nostalgic tweaks available in the latest beta version of 2.0.0 with more on the way!

For the best nostalgic experience, I recommend using the **[Golden Days](https://github.com/PoeticRainbow/golden-days/releases)** resource pack by **PoeticRainbow**. It comes with an abundance of nostalgic packs, such as an alpha and picture perfect pack which coincides wonderfully with **Nostalgic Tweaks**.
 
## Configuration
To open the mod's configuration menu, press O for "Old" while in-game or at the game's title screen. Alternatively, if you have [mod menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) installed for Fabric, then you can also access the configuration screen through the Mods button. You can change the page that opens when pressing this hotkey by clicking the Settings button on the mod's settings homepage. The first category that appears when this button is clicked is the General category. Under the Menu Settings subcategory, you can pick which menu that opens by default. The config hotkey can be also changed in the vanilla controls menu or the mod's General config menu.

Each tweak will have tags next their name in the configuration menu. Each tag identifies different aspects of each tweak. The most important tags are the Client, Server, and Reload/Restart tags. You can hover your mouse over each tag to see more information as a tooltip. You can also disable some tweak tags from appearing in the General category under the Menu Settings subcategory.

Currently, the configuration menu comes with a fairly simple search feature. Right now it only matches typed input by a tweak's locale name. You can broaden your search by using Search Tags. To see all the search tags available to you, access the General category and open the Search Tags subcategory to read more.

Lastly, the configuration menu does come with a few keyboard shortcuts. Ctrl + F opens the search box, Ctrl + S saves and exits the config menu, Esc exits the config menu, and Ctrl + L, Alt + L, Ctrl + R, or Alt + R will change the the config group you are in without the need to click on a category button.
