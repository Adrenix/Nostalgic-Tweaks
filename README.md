## Mod Description
Inspired by Exalm's **Old Days** mod, **Nostalgic Tweaks** brings back a plethora of **Minecraft Alpha, Beta, and Post Release** lost or changed gameplay elements. This mod is intended for nostalgic enthusiasts who want to relive the glory days of Minecraft Java edition by tweaking the mod to their nostalgic preference.

Some major nostalgic tweaks included in this mod are **old classic/alpha/beta light rendering**, **old classic/alpha/beta fog rendering**, **old classic/alpha/beta sky and void colors**, **2D floating items with disabled diffused lighting**, **old mob spawning**, **old combat mechanics & aesthetics** (_e.g., disabled particles, sounds, and mob animations_), and **so much more**! There are currently over **300+** nostalgic tweaks available in the latest beta version of 2.0.0 with more on the way!

For the best nostalgic experience, I recommend using the **[Golden Days](https://github.com/PoeticRainbow/golden-days/releases)** resource pack by **PoeticRainbow**. It comes with an abundance of nostalgic packs, such as an alpha and picture perfect pack which coincides wonderfully with **Nostalgic Tweaks**. Additionally, use the **[Modern Beta](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modern-beta)** mod by **b3spectacled** for nostalgic terrain generation.
 
## Configuration
To open the mod's configuration menu, press **O** for "**Old**" while in-game or at the main title screen. This hotkey can be changed in the vanilla controls menu or in the mod's configuration menu. You can change the page that opens when pressing this hotkey by clicking the **Settings** button on the mod's settings homepage. The first category that appears when this button is clicked is the **General** category. Under the **Menu Settings** subcategory, you can pick which menu that opens by default. If you have **[Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)** installed for Fabric, then you can also access the configuration screen through the **Mods** button.

Each tweak will have **tags** next their name in the configuration menu. Each tag identifies different aspects of each tweak. The most important tags are the **Client**, **Server**, and **Reload/Restart** tags. You can hover your mouse over each tag to see more information as a tooltip. You can also disable some tweak tags from appearing in the **General** category under the **Menu Settings** subcategory.

The configuration menu comes with a special **Search** system. Text that is typed into the input bar will bring up fuzzy results by default. This means the mod will attempt to show results that it believes you were trying to search for. Some results will appear due to category names or related term searches. You can narrow search results by using **Search Tags**. To see all the search tags that are available, access the **General** category and open the **Search Tags** subcategory to read more.

The configuration menu also comes with keyboard shortcuts. **Ctrl + F** opens the search box, **Ctrl + S** saves and exits the config menu, **Esc** exits the config menu, and **Ctrl + L**, **Alt + L**, **Ctrl + R**, or **Alt + R** will change the the config group you are in without the need to click on a category button. You can also use the **Tab** key to cycle through elements and press the **Spacebar** key or **Enter** key to perform an action on the highlighted element.

The **Presets** button on the mod's settings homepage allows the user to define config presets similar to how resource packs are managed. _This feature is still in development and not yet available to use_.
