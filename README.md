## Mod Description
Inspired by Exalm's **Old Days** mod, **Nostalgic Tweaks** brings back a plethora of **classic, alpha, beta, and post-release** lost or changed gameplay elements. This mod is intended for nostalgic enthusiasts who want to relive the glory days of Minecraft Java edition by tweaking the mod to their nostalgic preference.

Some of the major nostalgic tweaks included are **old classic and pre-beta 1.8 light engines**, **old fog rendering**, **old sky and void colors**, **2D floating items with disabled diffused lighting**, **old mob spawning**, **old combat mechanics**, **old game screens**, **old C418 music**, and **so much more**! There are currently over **400+** nostalgic tweaks as of 2.0.0-Beta 9 with more on the way!

For the best nostalgic experience, I recommend using the **[Golden Days](https://github.com/PoeticRainbow/golden-days/releases)** resource pack by **PoeticRainbow**. It comes with an abundance of nostalgic packs, such as an alpha and picture perfect pack which coincides wonderfully with **Nostalgic Tweaks**. Additionally, use the **[Modern Beta](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modern-beta)** mod by **b3spectacled** or **[Moderner Beta](https://modrinth.com/mod/moderner-beta)** by **BlueStaggo** for nostalgic terrain generation.
 
## Configuration
To open the mod's config menu, press **O** for "**Old**" while in-game or at the game's title screen. This hotkey can be changed in the vanilla controls menu or in the mod's config menu. If you have **[Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)** installed for Fabric, then you can also access the configuration screen through the **Mods** button.

Each tweak will have **tags** above their names in the config menu. Each tag identifies different aspects of each tweak. You can hover your mouse over each tag to see more information as a tooltip. You can favorite the tweak, see its status, modify the client/server value, save, undo, reset, and modernize a tweak within its configuration box.

The config menu comes with searching capabilities. Search queries that are typed into the input box will bring up fuzzy results. This means the mod will attempt to show results that it believes you were trying to search for. You can narrow search results by using **Search Tags**. To see all the search tags that are available, open the config menu and click the **Manage** button in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Then go to the "Help" category and scroll down.

The config menu also comes with keyboard shortcuts. **Ctrl + F** focuses the search box, **Ctrl + S** saves the config menu, **Esc** exits the config menu, and **Ctrl + Left Arrow**, **Alt + Left Arrow**, **Ctrl + Right Arrow**, or **Alt + Right Arrow** will change the category group you are in without the need to click on a category button. You can also use the **Tab** key and **Directional Arrow** keys to cycle through and navigate the various widgets in the menu. Press the **Spacebar** key or **Enter** key to perform an action on the highlighted element.
