Inspired by Exalm's Old Days mod, Nostalgic Tweaks brings back a plethora of Minecraft Alpha, Beta, and Post Release lost or changed gameplay elements. This mod is intended for nostalgic enthusiasts who want to relive the glory days of Minecraft Java edition by tweaking the mod to their nostalgic preference.

## Mod Description
Nostalgic Tweaks in version 1.0 comes with four major categories; Sounds, Eye Candies, Animations, and Swing Speeds. Some of these categories will have their own subcategories that clump together related tweaks. To achieve the most nostalgic experience, it is recommend to use the [Golden Days](https://github.com/PoeticRainbow/golden-days/releases) resource pack by PoeticRainbow.

The mod currently has over 70+ nostalgic tweaks that can all be used in singleplayer. Tweaks that are controlled by the server are tagged as such in the mod's config menu. Multiplayer support is the next priority on the mod's project road map. Until then, tweaks that are controlled by the server will only run on singleplayer in version 1.x.x. See the `-multiplayer` appended branches for current server related development. To download beta builds, join the mod's [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/jWdfVh3) server.
 
## Configuration
To open the mod's configuration menu, press O for "Old" while in-game or at the game's title screen. Alternatively, if you have [mod menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) installed for Fabric, then you can also access the configuration screen through the Mods button. You can change the page that opens when pressing this hotkey by clicking the Settings button on the mod's settings homepage. The first category that appears when this button is clicked is the General category. Under the Menu Settings subcategory, you can pick which menu that opens by default. The config hotkey can be also changed in the vanilla controls menu or the mod's General config menu.

The Custom Speeds button on the mod's settings homepage allows a user to define swing speeds for individual items. To change the speed of different categories (e.g., blocks, tools, items, etc.), or to define a global swing speed, access the Settings menu and click on the Swing category button. Further instructions are displayed on the configuration screen.

Each tweak will have tags next their name in the configuration menu. Each tag identifies different aspects of each tweak. The most important tags are the Client, Server, and Reload/Restart tags. You can hover your mouse over each tag to see more information as a tooltip. You can also disable some tweak tags from appearing in the General category under the Menu Settings subcategory.

Currently, the configuration menu comes with a fairly simple Search feature. Right now it only matches typed input by a tweak's locale name. You can broaden your search by using Search Tags. To see all the search tags available to you, access the General category and open the Search Tags subcategory to read more.

Lastly, the configuration menu does come with a few keyboard shortcuts. Ctrl + F opens the search box, Ctrl + S saves and exits the config menu, Esc exits the config menu, and Ctrl + L, Alt + L, Ctrl + R, or Alt + R will change the the config group you are in without the need to click on a category button.
